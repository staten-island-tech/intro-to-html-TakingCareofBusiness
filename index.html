            <p>Hey Mr Whalen, it's me your favorite student responsible for the best game project you've ever seen. I know what you are thinking. "Wow Thomas! This website is so good! You deserve a 100!" And I totally agree! In fact, even my hero Simon Saffeyah loved it so much that he decided to train me in code! Anyway can't wait to see you next year! Love you Mr Whalen! (PS All the code that didn't work in our project was made by Jordan Calderon)</p>
