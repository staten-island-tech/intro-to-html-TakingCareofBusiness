            <p>To my dearest Mr. Whalen. Hello! Welcome to my website. As your favorite student, I decided to put in extra effort in this website by copying my code from last year to get color!!! I hope you appreciate it. I am so excited to learn more under you and watch the back of the television whenever you put something up there and learn nothing!!! If possible you should mix up everyone's seats because I don't want to sit in the same smelly corner for the second year in a row. I hope I get to learn a lot this year, and I hope my older friends (Minul Gamage) was wrong when he said you were evil and set everyone up for failure. With much love, Thomas "Your favorite student ever" Christopher Nicholas Brown. </p>
